My name is Peter Caya and this is my blog!

In my daily role, I work as risk quant at a major bank. This draws on my background in scientific computing, statistics, artificial intelligence, and programming. I wanted to start keeping a blog on some topics I encounter in the realm of quantitative risk management, as well as some related topics from anti-money laundering and data-science.

In my free time I enjoy learning about history and foreign languages as well as training for ultramarathons.
