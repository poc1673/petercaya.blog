When I first registered as a member of ACAMS and began the process of preparing for the CAMS exam, I noticed that there were a lot of questions out there about the difficulty of the test, what study strategies work best, and what study materials help guarantee the greatest likelihood of passing. Now that I've set the exam behind me, I wanted to make a quick note of my experience passing the exam with one month of study while purchasing no additional materials or tutoring.

## My background
The bulk of my work is related to reviewing and assessing the financial and statistical models utilized by banks to ensure they are fit for their purpose. Part of this scope is that we receive a fair number of models related to fraud detection and anti-money laundering. Coming into this exam, my background related to best practices for compliance, but didn't extend to many other topics covered in the CAMS exam such as international AML/CFT standards. Due to this, I couldn't rely on the day-to-day experience many AML analysts who deal directly with the topic daily would have.

## Timeline

I aimed to finish the exam in about one month with about sixty hours of study. The choice of study time was based on estimates I had seen in communities like /r/antimoneylaundering. Based on that timeline, I set aside about two hours each day to begin preparing for the exam.

## Study Strategy

My strict time budget meant that I couldn't afford to grind through the material aimlessly. Instead, I created a master strategy at the outset which would help me identify material I was weakest in while regularly reassessing my performance.

To do this, I set myself an approach during the first few days which sought to

1. Give myself a broad idea of what material was covered in the book.
2. Generate a list of highlighted material I could use for concentrated review later on.

Here's the exact schedule I used for those first few days:

### Using flashcards and Anki

After the initial readings described above, I used the notes and highlights that I took to create a review system. The majority of the material in the exam is focused on memorizing definitions, procedures, and hierarchies. For instance: Being familiar with the Financial Action Task Force, its forty recommendations, and the relationship it has with its regional bodies. Since much of this was rote learning, I leaned heavily on the use of flashcards.

The CAMS exam study package actually includes a set of flashcards so this was a good start. To augment them, I created my own decks which left me with more than 500 additional cards for review. To organize and test the effectiveness I utilized the software and spaced repetition system provided by Anki to quickly prioritize weak areas.

I organized my cards based on tags helped narrow down the topic area. These tags included details like the chapter in the CAMS exam book, and subject area:

### Using practice exams

In my opinion, the biggest difficulty in studying for the CAMS exam is the lack of accurate practice examinations. Ideally, I would like to set aside a group of accurate practice exams to regularly assess my progress, and identify weaknesses. While the CAMS study manual does include a sample exam, it's significantly easier than the actual exam (I passed with flying colors after fourteen hours of study). Aside from the question answers being easier, the formatting is easier as well.

For example, the practice test will present you with a question like the below:

While the actual exam will ask you to select three out of five. This makes it harder to use simple elimination to find the correct answer.

To help with this part, I drew from another very useful resource: ExamTopics. I am not sure what the source of the exam questions on this website is but this was the closest I could find in terms of difficulty and test format. There is one drawback though: The questions used on this website contain answers which may be incorrect, and in the comment section it's common to see respondents disagreeing with the results on the website.



## Reassessment

Using first the questions from the ACAMS prep guide, and then the questions from ExamTopics, I kept a running list of the exact questions I took, what selections I made, whether they were correct, and what the book actually said. The result was a log like this:

I tested myself on new questions from ExamTopics daily, assessed my performance, and kept a running tally to estimate my exam performance and what topics should be prioritized next. It turns out it was fairly accurate once exam day came!


## Conclusion

The CAMS exam requires thoughtful preparation based on your own background and time constraints. Coming at it from someone who doesn't actively work with money laundering or compliance on a daily basis, I needed to ensure that I would be able to build the comprehensive knowledge to pass the exam on a constrained timeline. The result was a success and I wanted to write the walk-through that I wish I had before beginning exam preparation.
