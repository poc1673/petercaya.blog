I've been running marathons for the past four years. With the return to doing official races that came in 2022, I wanted to begin journaling my experiences with the races. Any race ends up becoming a memorable experience, but I think it also makes sense to keep these records short since a lot of the novelty occurs purely in one's own head while running

I ran the Pittsburgh marathon for the third time last Sunday. This would count as my third time running this race. It carries a special place for me as was my first recorded race when I ran it in 2018. It's also been the most fun - The city closes down, huge crowds come out, and there are a lot of great aid stations.

For Pittsburgh 2022, I hoped to get a personal best of three hours and thirty-five minutes but ended up being slightly behind my current personal best. Without relying on excuses, I think that this is due to some mitigating factors. First, due to some transportation mixups, I had to walk/jog down to the starting line from Bloomfield. This meant that to start the race, I had about three miles under my belt already. The lack of transportation also meant I had to walk back up Penn avenue to get back to my house! Additionally, about half of the race occurred during a downpour. The worst of it coincided with my cohort crossing the hot metal bridge halfway through the race where the word "monsoon" comes to mind. Nonetheless, we made it through it!

# What's next?

Finishing this race was an incremental success but also a challenge. I think given the less than ideal situation getting downtown and the weather I'm happy with my performance but a lot of things can be tweaked. One major piece is my body composition. Distance running favors people with a lower weight and while I'm at a healthy weight, the nature of the event means that I would do much better losing some weight. I'm going to revive my old spreadsheet model for weight management.

This race was also an incremental step while preparing for a yet-to-be determined fifty miler. I think that it should put me about 3/4 of the way to being fully trained for a road 50 miler, and about half trained for a trail race. That means the next three months will involve a lot more time on trails around the city while I prepare.
