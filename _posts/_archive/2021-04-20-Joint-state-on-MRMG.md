On April 9, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the comptroller of the Currency issued a [joint statement](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-43a.pdf) with FINCEN describing how the principles of model risk management apply to BSA/AML models. Some of the topics addressed in the statement included:

1.  Definition of a model and how this applies to the systems used for anti-money laundering and fraud,

2.  The structure of the testing surrounding AML/fraud models,

3.  The treatment of third-party models.

This is in-line with how the treatment of systems related to BSA/AML has evolved over the past few years as banks select more complex monitoring systems and the approach to model risk described in [SR 11-7](https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1107.htm) become more relevant to the area.

## What counts as a model?

All systems used to combat money laundering aren't necessarily models, but many of the key components that banks rely on the most are. There can be some ambiguity to what systems count, so SR 11-7 provides a succinct definition:

> the term *model* refers to a quantitative method, system, or approach that applies statistical, economic, financial, or mathematical theories, techniques, and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates.

To describes a model as some system that has the following components:

1.  An input component
2.  A component that transforms the input data based on some set of assumptions or methodology.
3.  Outputs results from the second step to the use for decision making.

## How do we make sure that the models are fit for their purpose?

The primary consequence of components of an AML/BSA program falling under the definition of a model given above is the increased scrutiny required of them. The joint statement describes the standards:

> For automated transaction monitoring systems, prudent risk management involves periodically reviewing and testing the filtering criteria and thresholds to ensure that they are still effective, as well as independently validating the monitoring system's methodology and effectiveness to ensure that the monitoring system is detecting potentially suspicious activity.

Since these components are nontrivial, and are automated at some level, an ongoing monitoring program is necessary which answers several questions:

1.  Who has responsibility for the model?
2.  What ongoing monitoring tests will be used to regularly test the model?
3.  What is the range of acceptable results?
4.  What steps will be taken if the range of acceptable results is breached?

The choice for these different details varies widely between organizations and their needs for a model. A model which is considered shaky, but is high stakes may require quarterly testing while a more reliable model in a less important area might be reviewed every year. The concept to keep in mind here is **risk based**. [ACAMS Today](https://www.acamstoday.org/the-risk-based-principle-of-aml-management/#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20the%20%E2%80%9Crisk%2D,as%20a%20response%20to%20these) nicely defined it as:

> the "risk-based" principle requires financial institutions to assess the risks associated with illicit activities (such as money laundering and terrorist financing) that they may face in order to reasonably deploy corresponding resources before taking prioritized control measures as a response to these risks.

## Handling third party models

Many institutions can't develop their own money laundering models due to the size of the organization, unavailability of internal data, or the absence of model developers to create a custom system. Instead, they must rely on third-party models which can provide a product that will fit the institution's needs, as well as the technical support for a practical application.

While the use of third-party models is a great option for many institutions, it's important to recognize that it doesn't move the responsibility for effective risk management procedures to the third party:

> Banks are ultimately responsible for complying with BSA/AML requirements, even if they choose to use third-party models to assist with their BSA/AML compliance programs. In doing so, banks may consider the principles discussed in the agencies' third-party risk management issuance and the aspects of the MRMG that address third-party models

### Conclusion

The recent joint statement concentrates on how model risk management principles apply to systems used to identify money laundering. This framework is outlined in the Federal Reserve's Guidance on Model Risk Management which describes how to identify models and what expectations there are for assessment and ongoing monitoring. While the same rules for model risk management also apply to money laundering, special care has to be taken when creating the ongoing monitoring program due to the changing nature of financial crime. However, thoughtful application of risk management principles will mean a more effective AML program which may require less time and analyst resources.
