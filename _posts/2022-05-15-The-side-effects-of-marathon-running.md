My distance running journey began eight years ago when my friend and I were hiking in the Adirondacks and decided to run a 15 mile train race ([Wellsville's RidgeWalk and Run for those curious](http://www.ridgewalk.com/)) near my home town. Long story short - we had a blast running those hills! 

 
It was one of the best experiences of my life. From then on, I kept up with running and it became a big part of my life.What I want to do in this post is explain to the reader some of the ways that this odd practice has brought to my life.

## I've been humbled by the people I've met
I took pride in my training progress but I wasn't ready for the experience of being humbled by the people I'd meet at the races. While the true competitors who can finish a race in 2 hours and 14 minutes are remarkeable, I'm more awed by the people I've met whose have singular discipline and stories.I've met people who had compelling "origin stories" for how they began running, people who had notched more than 200 marathons on their belt, and people who have done amazing adventure races. If you're at a race, you're likely to find someone with a story that will wow you and make you reevaluate what may be possible for you to do too. 

## It changed my relationship with fatigue

The conditioning from running hours each week has an added benefit: Physical tasks don't fatigue me the way they did before I started running. Having the baseline of fitness was handy when my wife and I were moving ourselves into our new house a few months ago. During that time, I had a part time job moving things between our old apartment and the house. I think part of the reason that I had the energy and focus to arrive at the old apartment at 5 in the morning to move, then go through a day of work, and then do a second round of moving at 7 pm was due having a strenuous exercise regiment. 

I'll also add that running in the morning has helped me maintain a "virtuous cycle" throughout the day. If I start at 4:30 AM by running ten miles in the snow, then anything I encounter that day at work is going to seem easier by comparison. Spending twelve hours at the office seems like nothing if you spent the last Saturday running in the mountains for twelve hours!

## Distance runners seem to age well 
The age range of distance runners appealed to me when I was first starting. Winners tend to be younger, but perhaps not as young as you may imagine. According to [this](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6363528_Marathon_runners_-_How_do_they_age) paper, the elite runners tend to be between 25 and 35. 

The age range of the people that can finish a marathon in a good time is ([very wide](https://www.meteor.run/running-event/summary/Marathon))! Anecdotally, I've seen this born out even further in ultramarathoning events where raw athleticism takes a back seat to grit. 

Running has obvious benefits for the cardiovascular system, but I often hear that I am burning through my joints. From my own experience, the more running I've done the *fewer* joint and knee issues I've had. [Expert advice](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/health/injury/a775718/what-all-runners-need-to-know-about-joint-health/) seems to indicate that a running regiment is more likely to protect joints than damage them. 


## Distance running made me realize that it wasn't the fix to weight issues
I started running after losing 70 pounds and it was going to be my cornerstone for continued weight management. However, with time I've realized that it isn't the end-all be-all for managing bodyweight composition. This is because running primarily burns calories (as opposed to building muscle) which means I can still sabotage a run by eating too much. The old adage applies: "You can't outrun a bad diet." 

Because of that, I've had to be even more careful about managing my diet. I weigh myself regularly, estimate the calories I burn each day, and then plan out my diet based on what macro-nutrients and calories I need. 

# Wrapping things up

Running has been an enriching experience for me - and if you google reasons to get started, you'll find countless articles telling you the range of benefits. I wanted to add my observations to the pile - and hopefully provide a more personal explanation of what one can expect with distance running.
