My distance running journey began eight years ago when my friend and I were hiking in the Adirondacks and decided to run a 15 mile train race ([Wellsville's RidgeWalk and Run for those curious](http://www.ridgewalk.com/)) near my home town. Long story short - we had a blast running those hills!

It was one of the best experiences of my life. From then on, I kept up with running and it became a big part of my life.What I want to do in this post is explain to the reader some of the ways that this odd practice has brought to my life.

## I've been humbled by the people I've met
For me, training allowed me to take a lot of pride with my progress. What I wasn't ready for was the experience of being completely humbled by the people I'd meet at the start or finish line (or during the race). I'm not talking about the people that inevitably win - I never counted myself as being in the same league as someone who runs a 2 hour and 14 minute marathon! I'm think of the people who, no matter how hard you've worked, or the story sorrounding it, you're likely to find someone with a story that will wow you. I've met people who had compelling "origin stories" for how they began running, people who had notched more than 200 marathons on their belt, and people who have done amazing adventure races. 

When the effort I put in was compared to some of these people, what I did stopped seeming so remarkeable. It emphasized that it was never enough to satisfied with my progress and that there was always more.

## I no longer get physically tired in the same way

The conditioning from running for hours every week has an added side-benefit which is that physical tasks don't result in fatigue the way they might before I started running. Having the base line of fitness was handy when my wife and I were moving ourselves into our new house a few months ago. During that time, I had a part time job moving things between our old apartment and the house. I think part of the reason that I had the energy and focus to arrive at the old apartment at 5 in the morning to move, then go through a day of work, and then do a second round of moving at 7 pm was due having a strenuous exercise regiment. The benefits extend further: Traveling on foot, hiking, 

I'll also add that running in the morning has helped me maintain a "virtuous cycle" throughout the day. If I start at 4:30 AM by running ten miles in the snow, then anything I encounter that day is going to seem easier by comparison.

## Distance running draws a wide range of people 
The age range of distance runners appealed to me when I was first starting. Winners tend to be younger, but perhaps not as young as you may imagine. According to [this](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6363528_Marathon_runners_-_How_do_they_age) paper, the elite runners tend to be between 25 and 35. 

The age range of the people that can finish a marathon in a good time is ([very wide](https://www.meteor.run/running-event/summary/Marathon))! Anecdotally, I've seen this born out even further in ultramarathoning events where raw athleticism takes a back seat to grit. 

Running has obvious benefits for the cardiovascular system, but I often hear that I am burning through my joints. From my own experience, the more running I've done the *fewer* joint and knee issues I've had. [Expert advice](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/health/injury/a775718/what-all-runners-need-to-know-about-joint-health/) seems to indicate that a running regiment is more likely to protect joints than damage them. 


## Distance running isn't a panaceaa to weight issues
I started running after losing 70 pounds and it was going to be my cornerstone for continued weight management. However, with time I've realized that it isn't the end-all be-all for managing bodyweight composition. This is because running primarily burns calories (as opposed to building muscle) which means I can still sabotage a run by eating too much. The old adage applies: "You can't outrun a bad diet." 

Because of that, I've had to be even more careful about managing my diet. I weigh myself regularly, estimate the calories I burn each day, and then plan out my diet based on what macro-nutrients and calories I need. 

# Conclusion
Running has been an enriching experience for me - and if you google reasons to get started, you'll find countless articles telling you the range of benefits. I wanted to add my observations to the pile - and hopefully provide a more personal explanation of what one can expect with distance running.
