This is a quick summary of what I'm up to right now which I'll update every month. It's inspired by Derek Sivers' blog so I'll let him give the justification which I'm coattail riding:

> So a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a “now page”.
>
>...
>Think of what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year.

 
 
So, without delaying further without justification:

# Ultramarathon running

I've done ten marathons and two ultramarathons. I've also done more marathon distances than I can count solo. I love the challenge that it gives me and view it as a way of training for adversity. I'm in the process of deciding what races I want this year, but I want to do a distance greater than or equal to fifty miles sometime in the summer or fall.

# This blog

There are a lot of data science blogs, and there are a lot of blogs on finance/anti-money laundering. I wanted to combine the two.



# Language stuff
I like learning about languages in my free time. This isn't something I'm actively applying myself to, but in the past I've learned French well enough to make myself understood, if not quickly. I have an easier time reading the news/books in the language than I do speaking it.
