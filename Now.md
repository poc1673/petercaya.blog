This is a quick summary of what I'm up to right now which I'll update every month. It's inspired by Derek Sivers' blog so I'll let him give the justification which I'm coattail riding:

> So a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a “now page”.
>
>...
>Think of what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year.

 
 
So, without delaying further without justification:
# This blog

I originally intended this blog as a data science and anti-moneylaundering blog, but I've decided to use it to document my different projects which extend to fitness, general learning, and other data science problems.  

# Ultramarathon running

I've done ten marathons and two ultramarathons. I've also done more marathon distances than I can count solo. I love the challenge that it gives me and view it as a way of training for adversity. I'm in the process of deciding what races I want this year, but I want to do a distance greater than or equal to fifty miles sometime in the summer or fall.



# Language stuff
My main hobby outside of work is language learning but I'm currently on a hiatus from it. My feeling on my ability with French is that it's "good enough" for the original goal I had for being able to read and process the language. That said, I'm feeling out my interest in enrolling in a class and trying to obtain a classification as B2/C1 with the language.


#  Reading list

There are a wide list of topics that I'm always interested in, but I am trying to focus myself on math, machine learning, and business. Right now I'm reading:

1. The Age of AI: And Our Human Future - Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, Daniel Huttenlocher
2. The Resilient Society - Markus Brunnermeir
3. Serious Python - Julien Danjou


I'm also drawing from Hull's book on derivative contracts, but this is not a cover to cover read of the text.
